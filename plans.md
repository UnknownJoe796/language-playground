- Alternate Execution Mode
    - Scopes have context identifier
    - Declare Executor
        - Turn current execution into the default executor
        - Declare alternative executors
            - Naming convention relative to context name
    - Run with executor
        - Called using functions
        - `executor(() -> x)`
- Psuedo-mutable Syntax
    - Re-define shifts around declaration binding
    - Convert scope to graph - basically, make non-public declarations private
    - Merge context and function to being the same thing
    - `export` keyword, just like JS?
